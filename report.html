    <h2>About My Supervisor</h2>
    <p>As for my supervisor, Dr. Judi McCuaig is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph. She received her PhD from the University of Saskatchewan in 2000 and subsequently worked as a Senior Research Scientist at Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland, Washington, until 2004. She then joined the University of Guelph, where she has been actively involved in research and teaching​.</p>
    <p>Dr. McCuaig’s research focuses on leveraging computer systems to enhance learner engagement in post-secondary education. Her work includes the use of data mining, intelligent software systems, personalization, and user modeling to develop effective learning tools. Key areas of her research include automated formative feedback and the development of conversational agents to assist students with task decomposition and work planning. Her projects aim to improve self-regulation and independent learning among students​.</p>
    <p>Additionally, Dr. McCuaig has been involved in several funded projects aimed at improving educational outcomes. For example, she received funding from the Physical Science & Engineering Education Research Centre (PSEER) to develop a framework for automated task decomposition and work planning, particularly beneficial for neurodiverse learners​​.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>During my work term, I set several goals to enhance my professional skills and contribute effectively to my workplace. My primary goals were:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To communicate effectively with my co-workers and supervisor, providing regular updates and contributing to discussions.</li>
        <li>To learn project management through GitLab, including creating and managing tickets on the issue board.</li>
        <li>To improve my problem-solving skills by breaking down complex tasks and creating clear action plans.</li>
        <li>To manage my time effectively, completing tasks on time and with high quality.</li>
        <li>To develop intercultural competence by working effectively with diverse colleagues.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>I'm pleased to say that I successfully met all of these goals. For effective communication, I maintained regular contact with my supervisor through Microsoft Teams, providing daily updates and seeking clarification when needed. I also collaborated closely with my co-workers, often discussing our approach to tasks in person.</p>
    <p>In terms of technological literacy, I significantly improved my skills with GitLab. Our team opened an average of 26.8 issues and closed 21.8, demonstrating my ability to create, manage, and resolve tickets effectively.</p>
    <p>For problem-solving, my co-worker and I developed several planning documents, breaking down complex tasks like creating an FAQ site for SOCS. We researched existing sites, compiled resources, and consulted with professors to ensure a comprehensive solution.</p>
    <p>Regarding time management, I not only met deadlines but also focused on quality. I involved faculty members in reviewing our work, which led to valuable feedback and improvements, such as making our tutorials more user-friendly.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I successfully worked on my intercultural competence. I developed strong relationships with my co-worker and supervisor, navigating minor conflicts through open communication and fostering a productive work environment.</p>
    <p>The technologies I worked with, including GitLab and Microsoft Teams, along with web development skills, will be invaluable in my future work experiences. These tools are widely used in the industry, and my proficiency will be an asset. I also dabbled in a little bit of API testing towards the end of the work term, this is also something I would’ve preferred more time with in order to solidify my skills.</p>
    <p>Reflecting on my goals, I'm satisfied with my progress in all areas. While I didn't have any unsuccessful goals, I identified areas for continuous improvement, such as further enhancing the user-friendliness of our deliverables based on feedback. This experience has provided me with a strong foundation in project management, communication, problem-solving, and teamwork, which will undoubtedly benefit me in my future professional endeavors.</p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research institutional teaching policies</strong><ol>Conduct thorough research on institutional teaching policies and existing instructional informational resources.</ol></li>
        <li><strong>Design a SharePoint repository</strong><ol>Design a user-friendly and accessible internal SharePoint repository for sharing teaching resources among course instructors in the School of Computer Science.</ol></li>
        <li><strong>Consult with faculty and staff</strong><ol>Consult with faculty and teaching staff in the School of Computer Science to determine the informational resources needed.</ol></li>
        <li><strong>Content Management</strong><ol>Gather, curate, and post content on the SharePoint site to ensure it is up-to-date and comprehensive.</ol></li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of the interesting aspects of this job is that we used GitLab for project management. We learnt how to create tickets, epics, and how to manage sprints. This was very useful because it made managing the project and understanding our progress very easy.</p>
    <p>Skills that were needed for this job was knowing UI design and how to implement them in figma along with a basic understanding of how to use Sharepoint. I knew how to use figma and UI design principles from past courses and personal projects however Sharepoint was new for me and I learnt it on the spot. Sharepoint is easy to use but can get harder for more complex use cases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GitLab for project management</li>
        <li>UI design and Figma</li>
        <li>SharePoint development</li>
        <li>Microsoft Teams</li>
        <li>Web development</li>
        <li>API testing (brief exposure)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Since I was working with one more individual I also used this as an opportunity to enhance my communication skills not just with the co-worker but also the supervisor and other faculty members.</p>
   
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, my work term at the School of Computer Science has been an invaluable experience, marking significant growth in my professional skills and personal development. Through developing a SharePoint repository for teaching resources, I successfully met all my initial goals: improving communication, learning project management with GitLab, enhancing problem-solving skills, managing time effectively, and developing intercultural competence. This experience provided practical application of classroom knowledge and introduced me to new technologies like SharePoint, while reinforcing my proficiency in tools like Microsoft Teams and web development. The collaborative nature of the project, involving consultations with faculty and close teamwork, honed my ability to work effectively in a professional environment. While I achieved my objectives, this experience also highlighted areas for future growth, such as API testing. Overall, this work term has been a crucial stepping stone in my journey, equipping me with the tools, confidence, and insights needed to excel in my future career in the technology sector.</p>
    
    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>I would also like to acknowledge the people who have aided my coworker and I through this work term, this includes Prof. Judi McCuaig, Prof. Stacey Scott, Kyle Johnston, Shamsi Shinin, and all those who helped in making this a successful and memorable moment.</p>
